= Styling List Pages & Class Names =

List pages that are shown from your IRM site can be styled using the following class names. Please note that they will take on any default list styles that you already have on your existing Wordpress site. List pages start with the shortcode irmlist and then the category for the list.

The list comes with some basic formatting which can be overridden with the css classes.

= Class Names =

- table.newsitems : the container for the table where the articles are listed.
- div.article : wrapped around each list item.
- span.articleDate : for the list item date.
- span.fileSizeLabel : the wording "File Size".
- span.fileSize : the size of the file.
- div.ItemTickerCode : if the item has an associated ticker code it will show up here.
- .article a : targets the link and title for the article.
- span.articleBrief : the brief if any for the article.
